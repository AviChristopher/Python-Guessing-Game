# Python-Guessing-Game
 This game asks the user to guess a number within the given range. In this case, it is between 1 and 100. If the user guesses below or above this range, a Value Error message will appear and will ask the user to guess again.
 
 If the user inputs a number between 1 and 100, the game guides the user to guess higher or lower until he/she guesses correctly. The number of guesses after each round will be stored in a list and the mean,median and mode is calculated from the list.
 
 At the game of the game, the user is prompted to play again or quit. The highscore is displayed(the least number of guesses) at the end of each round.
 The User is shown an end message if he/she decides to quit.
